hypertext system in 1989, and since that time a lot of HTML versions were developed.

Explanation:

<!DOCTYPE>: It is used to define the document type. It can also be used to instruct the browser about the HTML version.

<html>:Defines the root of an HTML document. It is a tag which is used to specify to the browser that it is an HTML document. It contains all the elements of HTML other than <!DOCTYPE> and thus the web document is described by the text between HTML tag.

<head>: It is a tag inside the <html> tag, also the first element inside the <html> element which is used as a container for the metadata (data about data) and is closed before the body tag opens. Here, metadata means the information related to the document.
The HTML <meta> Element
The <meta> element is typically used to specify the character set, page description, keywords, author of the document, and viewport settings.
The metadata will not be displayed on the page, but is used by browsers (how to display content or reload page), by search engines (keywords), and other web services.
<meta charset="UTF-8">
<meta name="description" content="Free Web tutorials">
<meta name="keywords" content="HTML, CSS, JavaScript">
<meta name="author" content="John Doe">
<title>: It is the next tag and an optional tag placed inside the <head> tag which is used to add a title to the HTML page and is closed immediately. This title appears at the top of the browser window.

<body>:	Defines the document's body. It is a tag inside the <html> tag, also the next element inside the <html> element after the <head> element, which is used as a container for the body content of the page, also the main content of the HTML document. These contents are visible to the end-user.

HTML Elements
The HTML element is everything from the start tag to the end tag:
<tagname>Content goes here...</tagname>
Some HTML elements have no content (like the <br> element). These elements are called empty elements. Empty elements do not have an end tag!

Nested HTML Elements
HTML elements can be nested (this means that elements can contain other elements).
All HTML documents consist of nested HTML elements.


HTML is Not Case Sensitive
HTML tags are not case sensitive: <P> means the same as <p>.


HTML Attributes
HTML attributes provide additional information about HTML elements.

HTML Attributes
All HTML elements can have attributes
Attributes provide additional information about elements
Attributes are always specified in the start tag
Attributes usually come in name/value pairs like: name="value"

<a href="https://www.w3schools.com">Visit W3Schools</a>href attribute specifies the URL of the page the link goes to
<img src="img_girl.jpg"> The src attribute specifies the path to the image to be displayed:

HTML Headings
There are 6 heading tags.
Browsers automatically add some white space (a margin) before and after a heading.

Headings Are Important
Search engines use the headings to index the structure and content of your web pages.

Users often skim a page by its headings. It is important to use headings to show the document structure.

<h1> headings should be used for main headings, followed by <h2> headings, then the less important <h3>, and so on.
Note: Use HTML headings for headings only. Don't use headings to make text BIG or bold.

HTML Paragraphs
The HTML <p> element defines a paragraph.
A paragraph always starts on a new line, and browsers automatically add some white space (a margin) before and after a paragraph.

HTML Display
You cannot be sure how HTML will be displayed.

Large or small screens, and resized windows will create different results.

With HTML, you cannot change the display by adding extra spaces or extra lines in your HTML code.

The browser will automatically remove any extra spaces and lines when the page is displayed

HTML Horizontal Rules->	Defines a thematic change in the content
The <hr> tag defines a thematic break in an HTML page, and is most often displayed as a horizontal rule.
The <hr> element is used to separate content (or define a change) in an HTML page.

HTML Line Breaks->Inserts a single line break
The HTML <br> element defines a line break.
Use <br> if you want a line break (a new line) without starting a new paragraph.The <br> tag is an empty tag, which means that it has no end tag.

HTML <pre> Element->Defines pre-formatted text
The HTML <pre> element defines preformatted text.
The text inside a <pre> element is displayed in a fixed-width font (usually Courier), and it preserves both spaces and line breaks

HTML Style Attribute->Setting the style of an HTML element, can be done with the style attribute.
Use the style attribute for styling HTML elements
Use background-color for background color
Use color for text colors
Use font-family for text fonts
Use font-size for text sizes
Use text-align for text alignment
